# Crop Recommendation System 

## Description
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning application designed to help farmers select suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. By analyzing factors such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels, the system provides personalized crop recommendations to optimize yields and maximize profitability.

## Key Features
- **Input Data Collection:** Users can input soil parameters, climate data, and geographic location.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The system preprocesses input data to handle missing values, normalize features, and transform categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Various algorithms are utilized, including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Models are trained on historical data and evaluated for accuracy using performance metrics.
- **Crop Recommendation:** The system suggests the most suitable crops based on the trained models and user inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive interface for easy data entry and viewing recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For model development and data processing.
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
